# 15-462 Project 3: Raytracing

This project demonstrates rendering using ray tracing, which traces lines from the eye to the environment to generate an image.

## Files Changed

Includes both .cpp and .hpp files.

- `src/p3/raytracer`
- `src/scene/texture`
- `src/scene/model`
- `src/scene/triangle`
- `src/scene/sphere`
- `src/scene/model`
- `src/p3/util`
- `shots/*`

## Details

### Virtual Functions

Virtual functions were used to make code more modular. In particular, a `trace_ray` method was added to the `Scene` class, and `intersect` and `color` methods were added to geometry classes. The implementation of these functions can be found in the respective source files for Triangle, Sphere, and Model.
